The system automates builds, testing, and deployments across dev and prod environments with CodeDeploy integration.

Build artifacts are uploaded to S3 and deployed via AWS CodeDeploy, while post-build scripts send changelogs and build status updates to a Telegram group. Prometheus monitors the Jenkins controller and agents through node_exporter, providing real-time visibility into resource usage and performance metrics.",

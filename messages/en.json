The system automates builds, testing, and deployments across dev and prod environments with CodeDeploy integration. Custom AMIs were built for Jenkins agents with preinstalled tools (JDK, Ant, Git, AWS CLI), and the pipeline dynamically provisions build agents to compile and deploy applications. Build artifacts are uploaded to S3 and deployed via AWS CodeDeploy, while post-build scripts send changelogs and build status updates to a Telegram group. Prometheus monitors the Jenkins controller and agents through node_exporter, providing real-time visibility into resource usage and performance metrics.",

Devices deployed behind NAT and firewalls initiate persistent, encrypted ISUP connections over the public Internet to a cloud-hosted HikGateway instance, eliminating the need for static IP addresses or inbound network exposure at customer sites. HikGateway acts as the centralized control plane, managing device registration, session lifecycle, status monitoring, and event handling. All device operations and third-party integrations are performed through HikGateway’s ISAPI interfaces over HTTPS, allowing external backend services to securely manage devices, retrieve events, and perform control actions without direct device access. The architecture emphasizes outbound-only connectivity, TLS-encrypted transport, strict network isolation, and API-driven integration, making it suitable for large-scale, multi-tenant deployments of Hikvision ISUP-enabled devices.",

The solution provides comprehensive visibility across the entire technology stack through multiple specialized exporters and collectors. Prometheus serves as the central metrics collection and storage system, scraping metrics from node_exporter (system metrics), jmx_exporter (Java application metrics), cAdvisor (container metrics), and a custom exporter for application-specific metrics. Grafana provides rich visualization dashboards for infrastructure health, application performance, and business metrics. Loki aggregates logs from all services, with Promtail collecting and forwarding log data from various sources. Alertmanager handles alert routing and deduplication, sending critical notifications directly to Telegram for real-time incident response. The entire stack is containerized and orchestrated for high availability and scalability, ensuring reliable monitoring even during infrastructure incidents.",

It allows users to receive Instagram content directly in their Telegram chats without manual link copying or app switching. The bot uses user binding tokens to securely connect each user's Instagram account ID with their Telegram account, enabling automatic forwarding of reels, posts and stories. Built with Python, FastAPI, and the Telegram Bot API, it includes both Free and Pro subscription plans, with Telethon handling payment processing and subscription validation. A PostgreSQL database is used to manage user information, payment data, and media statistics. The media retrieval API is containerized with Docker and deployed behind an Nginx reverse proxy, ensuring scalability, reliability, and secure content delivery.",
